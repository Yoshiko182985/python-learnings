# Jo's Code Journeys

 * helloworld.py - A hello world intro with a metric fuckton of notes 
 * helloworld2.py - A second file of notes because the first just wasn't enough
 * projectsfort.py - A glorified coding to-do list with some projects for T
 * make_tj_list.py - A confusing yet "dynamic" python file that makes a "dynamically created" html file
 * fontcolor.py - A cute lil file that makes using bash colors a LOT easier!

## And now to learn about MD format!

### Let's start with headers...
Headers are created by using pound signs! The more pound signs, the smaller the header!

*Italics can be created with asterisks* or _underscores!_

**Bolded text can be created with double asterisks** or __double underscores!__

**_You can even combine the two of them for itallicized and bolded font!_**

~~And if you use two tildes, you can get strikethough font!~~

`And use these little dot things to get monospace fonts!`

### How about links?

### And images!

### And finally, this is how you insert text blocks!

```
print ("Hello World!")
```
